# Highlighted_Projects
Small Repo of some of my highlighted projects the last few years. 

# Carnegie Internship Poster, Summer 2021
As part of my 2021 Internship, I had to summarise my completed research via a 3-page poster for display on the Funder's website. 
My task was to complete a semi-developed 2D LAMMPS (C++) model to simulate vortex dynamics of FtsZ proteins; a protein that 
exists amongst many bacteria types and is present during the initial stages of cell division. 

# 4th Yr Project, 2021-2022
My complete 4th Yr MPhys Project Report is available for viewing here. I acheived up to a 30% reduction in oxDNA simulation times 
within LAMMPS by optimising the package's handling of quaternions, a fundamental orientation-dependent co-ordinate system used 
within the model. My updated source code has now been added into the latest stable releases of LAMMPS, and the updated package was 
used to explore CAG repeat-sequence hairpin dynamics, representative of dsDNA segments found in a number of degenerative human 
genome defects.
